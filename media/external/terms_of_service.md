# MediaForge Terms of Service

## Liability and Ownership of Created Media

### MediaForge's Liability

The media that MediaForge creates is decided entirely by the input provided. I am not liable for any use or misuse of
the created media. By invoking a MediaForge command, you and the users who posted the media which is used in the command
claim full liability for the created media.

### Media Legal Rights

MediaForge is a bot for fun and is not designed for professional use. I make no guarantee that you have the legal rights
to the media created by MediaForge, as many open-source projects and various images are used that do not permit full
unrestricted use. Check with a lawyer before you do anything stupid, or just use a real editing program.

## Disallowed Usage of MediaForge

On the public MediaForge instance, you are NOT permitted to use it for bigotry, hate-speech, or illegal activity (such
as libel or doxxing). In the event that MediaForge is used in this way, MediaForge is NOT liable and the person who
invoked the command claims full responsibility.

## Bugs and Unexpected Behavior

MediaForge was programmed by a human, and therefore is susceptible to human and other forms of error. MediaForge makes
no guarantee of 100% intended behavior. If you
[report an issue on the GitHub](https://github.com/machineonamission/mediaforge/issues), I will be more likely to attempt
to correct the issue, though no guarantee is made.

## User and Server Bans

I reserve the right to ban any user or server from the public instance of MediaForge for any reason for any duration,
though typical reasons include spam, bigotry, or other misuses of the bot.

## AGPL3 + Commons Clause license

The MediaForge source code is licensed under a combination of GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later and the Commons Clause.
[Read more here](/LICENSE.md).

## Self-hosting

MediaForge is open-source and anyone can download the code and host their own copy of the bot. MediaForge does not
guarantee self-hosted copies will follow any of the terms nor does MediaForge take ANY responsibility for ANYTHING that
happens using self-hosted copies.

## Privacy Policy

The public MediaForge instance will attempt to uphold the [Privacy Policy](privacy_policy.md), though no guarantee is
made and no liability
is accepted if the privacy policy is not upheld.

## These Words Are Not Set in Stone

I maintain the right to change any of the terms, the license, or the privacy policy at any time for any reason and
continued usage of the bot indicates immediate acceptance of the new terms.

## Remember the Human

I am only human, and I make no guarantee that the services, practices, or terms listed advertised are 100% upheld. I am
not liable for any damages caused by MediaForge.
